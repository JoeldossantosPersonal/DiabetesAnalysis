Diabetes Prediction Project
The Pima Indian population have been heavily studied since 1965 on account of high rate of diabetes. This dataset contains measurements for 768 female subjects, all aged 21 and above. Can we figure out if someone will likely have diabetes just by taking a few of these measurements?Â  
This repository houses a predictive modeling project aimed at identifying diabetes within the Pima Indian population. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the project focuses on developing an accurate and reliable model for early detection and risk assessment.

Methods Used
The predictive model is built using various machine learning algorithms, with a primary emphasis on the J48 decision tree algorithm. Supervised training is employed to train the model on a dataset containing measurements from 768 female subjects aged 21 and above. The Weka explorer software is utilized for data preprocessing, exploration, and model development.

Model's Purpose
The primary objective of the model is to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on a set of relevant variables. Through the use of machine learning algorithms, the model aims to offer a practical and reliable tool for early identification of individuals at risk of diabetes within the Pima Indian population. The project contributes to the field of predictive healthcare analytics by providing a model that aligns with the unique characteristics of the target demographic.
